3. Choose a drive letter that you want to use to map to the network share ("J" is often used since people still refer to this share as the "Jesse Server")
4. Next to Folder, type in "\\col.missouri.edu\files\WC"

5. Make sure "Reconnect at logon" is checked

A new My Computer/Windows Explorer window should open up for the J: drive.  Your "J" drive is now mapped to the network share.
