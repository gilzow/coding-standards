# Frontend guidelines

## File structure

Structure your files to help keep things tidy for the backend people.
		
     - src (Source files not meant to go on the server)
          - less/sass
          - css (frameworks)
          - js 
          - images (PSD, AI, Sketch files)
		
     - dist (Compiled files to publish on VH, Wordpress or Cascade Server files)
          - css
          - fonts 
          - js 
          - images
