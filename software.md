# Software to get the job done

## [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/)

**Compile Everything:** Process Less, Sass, Stylus, Jade, Haml, Slim, CoffeeScript, Javascript and Compass files automatically each time you save. Easily set options for each language.

**Combine & Minify:** Reduce load times by mashing Javascript & CoffeeScript files together and then minifying with Uglify.js. It's so easy, you'll giggle like a schoolgirl. Seriously.
